Text Region Detection:
Objective: Identify the regions on the signboard where text is present.

Recognition of individual characters:
Objective: Recognize the individual characters within the detected text regions.

Natural Language Processing for translation/transliteration:
Objective: Translate or transliterate the recognized Hindi text to the desired target language.

To implement this project, you could consider the following steps:

Gather a dataset of Hindi signboard images with ground truth text annotations.
Develop and train the text region detection model.
Integrate the text region detection model to recognize individual characters.
Implement the NLP-based translation/transliteration module, utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on relevant datasets.
Integrate the components into a unified system that takes an input image, detects the text regions, recognizes the characters, and translates/transliterates the text to the desired language.
