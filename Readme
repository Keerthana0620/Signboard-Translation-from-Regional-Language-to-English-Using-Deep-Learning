Text Region Detection:
Objective: Identify the regions on the signboard where text is present.
Approach:
Use computer vision techniques like edge detection, connected component analysis, and segmentation to locate the text areas.
Potentially leverage pre-trained object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) fine-tuned on text region detection.
Ensure the detected text regions are robust to variations in font, size, orientation, and lighting conditions.
Recognition of individual characters:
Objective: Recognize the individual characters within the detected text regions.
Approach:
Employ optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, possibly using pre-trained OCR models (e.g., Tesseract, CRAFT).
Explore deep learning-based approaches like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large datasets of Hindi characters.
Handle challenges like touching/overlapping characters, variations in font, and noise/distortions in the input images.
Natural Language Processing for translation/transliteration:
Objective: Translate or transliterate the recognized Hindi text to the desired target language.
Approach:
Utilize NLP techniques like language modeling, machine translation, and transliteration.
Leverage pre-trained neural machine translation (NMT) models fine-tuned on Hindi-to-target language datasets.
Incorporate linguistic knowledge, such as Hindi grammar and syntax, to improve the translation quality.
Handle colloquialisms, idioms, and context-dependent meanings for more accurate translations.
To implement this project, you could consider the following steps:

Gather a dataset of Hindi signboard images with ground truth text annotations.
Develop and train the text region detection model using computer vision techniques.
Integrate the text region detection model with an OCR engine to recognize individual characters.
Implement the NLP-based translation/transliteration module, utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on relevant datasets.
Integrate the components into a unified system that takes an input image, detects the text regions, recognizes the characters, and translates/transliterates the text to the desired language.
Test the system extensively, measure its performance, and iterate on the individual components to improve the overall accuracy and robustness.
